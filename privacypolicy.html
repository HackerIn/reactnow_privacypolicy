  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last Updated: August 16, 2023</em></p>

  <p>
    Thank you for choosing to use <strong>React NOW!</strong> (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle
    information when you use our App. By downloading or using our App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>No Personal Data Collected:</strong> We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable
    information (PII) from users. The App does not request or require access to your name, email, phone number, or
    other personal details.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to understand how users engage with our App. Google
    Analytics may automatically collect certain non-personal information, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage data (e.g., screens viewed, time spent in the App)</li>
    <li>General geographic region (not precise location)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it cannot be used to identify you personally. It helps us improve
    the App’s features and usability. For more information on how Google Analytics handles user data, please review
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy &amp; Terms</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> We use the anonymous data from Google Analytics solely to understand
    usage patterns and improve the App’s performance, content, and user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share personal information with any third parties. However, to facilitate analytics, certain technical
    data is automatically collected and processed by Google Analytics. Again, no personally identifiable information
    is shared.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not store any personal data, we do not have user accounts or maintain databases of user information.
    Any data processed by Google Analytics is subject to Google’s security measures. We encourage you to read
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>
    to learn more about their data practices.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our App is not directed toward children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from
    children. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can
    remove the data, if any exists.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on our official
    website, and the “Last Updated” date at the top will be revised accordingly. Your continued use of the App after
    any modifications indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>

    If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at:
